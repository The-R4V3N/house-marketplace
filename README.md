## Features

The House Marketplace app offers a range of professional features for users, including:

- User Registration: Users can create an account to efficiently list their properties for sale or rent on the platform.

- Listing Management: Account holders have the ability to edit or delete their property listings, allowing for seamless   updates and adjustments as needed.

- Contact Functionality: Even non-registered users can easily contact the property owner or agent directly through the app, streamlining communication between interested parties.

- Mobile and Desktop Compatibility: The app is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal usability on smartphones and tablets. However, it also provides a responsive and user-friendly experience when accessed from desktop computers.

- Location Mapping: The app incorporates a mapping feature that visually displays the location of each property, providing potential buyers or renters with valuable geographical context.

- Interactive Slider: Both the explore page and listing page are equipped with an interactive slider, enhancing the user experience by allowing them to easily navigate through property images or other relevant visual content.

By offering these professional features, the House Marketplace app aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for buying, selling, or renting properties.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Set up your development environment and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
- Install Node.js from the [official Website](https://nodejs.org) if you dont have it already
- You will need a geocoding api key for this to work which you can obtain from google cloud
  
### In the project  directory run

 `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies

will be update once the project is done

  Now you are ready to use it
  
## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start` to start the app

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
